## Plotting indices

Once a TRIM model has been estimated, and indices are computed, these latter can be plotted using the generic plot command **plot** (which, behind the screens, calls **plot.trim.index**).

```{r}
library(rtrim)
data(skylark2) # load Skylark data
m <- trim(count ~ site + year, data=skylark2, model=3) # Run a fairly basic TRIM model
idx <- index(m) # By default, the indices for the imputed data set
plot(idx)
```
